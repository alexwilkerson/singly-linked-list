CSCI 2125: Homework 1
Fall 2016

For the most part, I stuck to the script with this assignment.
There were two additions I made to the program to make it more robust.
I implemented a function to check whether the user's input had the
correct number and order of parentheses. I also implemented a function
to verify that the user did not enter any illegal or invalid characters.

Also, in Part 2 iii, the homework required the defining of the method
isEmpty() which I have not implemented here because the MyStack class
that I created inherits from the SinglyLinkedList class which already
has an isEmpty() function. As such, I thought it redundant and have left
it out.

I've done my best to weed out any bugs and currently do not know of any.
Most of the functions I've written have been short and clean.
